# HiQPuzzle

This is a Java solution to the Hi-Q puzzle. 
This puzzle starts with pegs filled in almost all the holes of a cross-like shaped board. All the holes are filled except for one, the center of the board. The goal of the puzzle is to remove pegs one by one until there is just one peg left on the board. Pegs are removed by being 'jumped', where pegs can jump others if there is a vacancy in the hole two holes adjacent to it. The peg in between is jumped, and therefore removed. 
My solution shows the a 24 piece board, thus there are 23 moves needed in the solution. The user can get as many solutions as they like.
